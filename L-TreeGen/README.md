# L-TreeGen

L-TreeGen is a synthetic apple tree generation pipeline that uses [L-Py](https://github.com/openalea/lpy), a programming language based on L-systems, alongside [Helios++](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios) and Blender, to more accurately simulate organic branching patterns, enhance diversity, and model realistic sensing effects. It consists of a Real2Sim 3D tree model generator for **data realism** and virtual sensors including virtual RGB-D cameras and laser scanners for **sensing realism**.

## Real2Sim Generator

It starts from the reconstruction of base trees using the real geometric information. These base trees are separated into base organs including base trunks and branches. New organs are generated by the interpolation of base organs with augmentations.

## Blender Rendering

Built upon [Objaverse](https://github.com/allenai/objaverse-rendering), we included [Zero123++](https://github.com/SUDO-AI-3D/zero123plus?tab=readme-ov-file#camera-parameters), [LRM](https://github.com/3DTopia/OpenLRM), and our planar view rendering strategies.

## Virtual Laser Scanner

To enhance the realism of the point cloud quality, we used [Helios++](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios) to simulate the sensing effects, including occlusion and no-hit for small objects.
